Beer With Us

This is an app that provides information on Scottish brewries and Beers. You are able to find out infomation on brewries and find their location and the different beers that they sell. You are able to find out information on the beers such as avb and a description. I plan to add in a comments feature where users are able to check in where they have had a certain beer and include certain information.

API

The API for the information was created in ruby on rails currently there are 24 brewries all with multiple beers. I plan to add more brewries and beers. The comments section mentioned above will also be added.

Front End

The front end is written in React displaying the information from the API. It is very responsive with the map changing locations and removing markers depanding on what brewery is selected. 

Further

I am going to further developing this project and will use it to learn different skills. I hope to also make a mobile friendly version.
